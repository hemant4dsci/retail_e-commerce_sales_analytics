# Executive Summary
This report explores sales and profitability in the retail and e-commerce sector. The company has enjoyed steady sales growth, but profit margins have not kept pace. Management is particularly concerned about the impact of product returns, aggressive discounting, and uneven regional performance.

Our analysis takes a closer look at these challenges by breaking down profitability across products, geographies, and sales channels, while also examining trends over time. The findings highlight where revenue is leaking and provide practical recommendations the business can act on to strengthen margins and support sustainable growth.

# Introduction & Business Context

The retail and e-commerce industry is fast-moving and highly competitive. Companies often compete on price and promotions, which can boost sales in the short term but put pressure on profit margins in the long run. Even when sales volumes look healthy, profitability can be eroded by factors such as high return rates, frequent discounting, rising costs, and inconsistent performance across regions and channels.

In this project, we focus on a global retail company that operates across multiple continents, countries, brands, and sales channels. Although the business has achieved steady sales growth, profitability has been inconsistent. Management is particularly concerned about revenue leakage from returns, discounts, and low-margin products.

This analysis is designed to help the company get a clearer view of its sales and cost dynamics. By examining historical data, the project aims to uncover where profitability is being lost, highlight underperforming areas, and identify opportunities to improve margins. The insights generated will not only explain current challenges but also support more informed decisions going forward.

+ Compare regional and geographical performance to highlight markets with high sales but low profitability.

+ Identify trends and seasonality in sales and profit margins across years and quarters.

+ Highlight actionable insights and recommendations to improve overall profitability.

# Data Preparation & Cleaning  

The analysis was based on data stored in a **MySQL** relational database. Data from five separate tables was extracted and consolidated into a single sales summary table, providing a comprehensive view of sales, costs, returns, discounts, and profitability across products, channels, and regions.

Although the source data was already clean, basic data validation and standardization were performed to ensure accuracy and consistency:

+ Verified that numerical fields (sales, cost, returns, discounts) were consistent with expected business logic.

+ Standardized categorical fields such as product categories, brands, channels, and countries.

+ Ensured time-related fields (dates, years, quarters) were in proper formats for trend analysis.

+ Reconfirmed derived metrics:
    - Net Sales = Total Sales – Returns – Discounts

    - Net Profit = Net Sales – Total Cost

    - Profit Margin (%) = (Net Profit ÷ Net Sales) × 100

The resulting sales summary table was clean, consistent, and ready for exploratory analysis and reporting.
