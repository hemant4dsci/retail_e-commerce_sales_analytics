# Executive Summary

This report explores sales and profitability in the retail and e-commerce sector. The company has enjoyed steady sales growth, but profit margins have not kept pace. Management is particularly concerned about the impact of product returns, aggressive discounting, and uneven regional performance.

Our analysis takes a closer look at these challenges by breaking down profitability across products, geographies, and sales channels, while also examining trends over time. The findings highlight where revenue is leaking and provide practical recommendations the business can act on to strengthen margins and support sustainable growth.

# Introduction & Business Context

The retail and e-commerce industry is fast-moving and highly competitive. Companies often compete on price and promotions, which can boost sales in the short term but put pressure on profit margins in the long run. Even when sales volumes look healthy, profitability can be eroded by factors such as high return rates, frequent discounting, rising costs, and inconsistent performance across regions and channels.

In this project, we focus on a global retail company that operates across multiple continents, countries, brands, and sales channels. Although the business has achieved steady sales growth, profitability has been inconsistent. Management is particularly concerned about revenue leakage from returns, discounts, and low-margin products.

This analysis is designed to help the company get a clearer view of its sales and cost dynamics. By examining historical data, the project aims to uncover where profitability is being lost, highlight underperforming areas, and identify opportunities to improve margins. The insights generated will not only explain current challenges but also support more informed decisions going forward.

3. Compare regional and geographical performance to highlight markets with high sales but low profitability.

4. Identify trends and seasonality in sales and profit margins across years and quarters.

5. Highlight actionable insights and recommendations to improve overall profitability.

# Data Preparation & Cleaning  

The analysis was based on data stored in a **MySQL** relational database. Data from five separate tables was extracted and consolidated into a single sales summary table, providing a comprehensive view of sales, costs, returns, discounts, and profitability across products, channels, and regions.

Although the source data was already clean, basic data validation and standardization were performed to ensure accuracy and consistency:

+ Verified that numerical fields (sales, cost, returns, discounts) were consistent with expected business logic.

+ Standardized categorical fields such as product categories, brands, channels, and countries.

+ Ensured time-related fields (dates, years, quarters) were in proper formats for trend analysis.

+ Reconfirmed derived metrics:
    - Net Sales = Total Sales – Returns – Discounts
    - Net Profit = Net Sales – Total Cost
    - Profit Margin (%) = (Net Profit ÷ Net Sales) × 100

The resulting sales summary table was clean, consistent, and ready for exploratory analysis and reporting.

4. Return has very low impact on sales over time.

### Profit Margin over time

**Q: Is profit margin improving or declining over time?**

![Profit Margin over time](../figures/qtr_profit_margin.png)

**Insights :**

1. Retailers feel pressure to offer promotions to win customers from competitiors, sacrificing margins to retain or grow market share.

2. Shoppers expect deals and are less loyal to brands, switching easily to find the best price.

3. Holidays are often used to clear out inventory, sometimes at the cost of profitablity.

## Hypothesis Testing

### Profit Margin Distribution by Country

**Q : How do profit margins vary among different countries, and what factors might explain these differences?**

![Profit Margin Distribution by Country](../figures/margin_distribution_country.png)

**Insights :**

1. Most Profit Margins are near 0 :
    - For almost all countries, the boxes (IQR) and medians are clustered around 0.
    - This means the majority of sales have very small profit margins, possibly close to break-even.

2. Presence of extreme outliers :
    - Countries like China, Germany and United States show very high outliers (up to 600000+).
    - Negative outliers are also present (below -200000), meaning in some cases losses were very large.

### ANOVA on Profit Margin Across Countries

A one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was conducted to examine whether average profit margins differ significantly across different countries. This test helps identify if the variation in profit margins between countries is greater than would be expected by chance.

The ANOVA results showed an F-statistic of 0.3691, with a p-value of 0.999646. Since the p-value is greater than the significance level of 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that profit margins are equal across all countries.

This indicates that there is no statistically significant difference in profit margin distribution among countries. These findings suggest that country-specific factors may influence profitability, providing useful insights for targeted business strategies and regional performance improvements.

# Key Insights

1. The catalog channel currently underperforms in profit generation relative to other channels.

2. Home Appliances has highest sales (29.5%) but high returns (36.6%).

3. United States has highest sales but lowest profit margin (50.9%).

4. During holiday session where profit margin decline repidely.

---

# Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the company should: 

1. Investigate cost structures, pricing strategies or customer engagement to improve margins in Catalog channel.

2. Conduct a detailed quality and customer satisfaction analysis to identify root causes for the high return rates in the home appliances category.

3. For the United States, conduct a comprehensive analysis of pricing, discounting strategies, operational expenses, and return rates, and focus on optimizing these factors to enhance overall profit margin.

4. Monitor discount strategies closely during holiday periods to control profit erosion.

5. Optimize inventory for seasonal demand.

---

# Conclusion

This report reviews how sales and profits vary across different channels and regions, and points out where improvement is needed. The catalog channel is currently making less profit compared to others, meaning costs or pricing strategies need attention. Home appliances sell the most but have a high rate of returns, which lowers overall profit. The United States leads in total sales but has the smallest profit margin, so pricing and cost management there should be reviewed. Finally, profit margins drop quickly during holiday seasons because of heavy discounting. Addressing these issues with focused actions will help ensure stronger and more sustainable business growth.
